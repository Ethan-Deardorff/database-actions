# database-actions
A collection of actions and resources that use common syntax in order to interact with a database.

This is a project that is created for personal use, but anyone can also use this if this fits their situation. This project was created with the use in a Turso Database with the Drizzle ORM; this is how the syntax is formed in this package.
